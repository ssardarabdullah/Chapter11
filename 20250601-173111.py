Question 3____________
 Write a class called Employee.
The init() method should take 
in a first name, a last name,
and an annual salary, and
store each of these as attributes
. Write a method called 
give_raise() that adds $5,000 
to the annual salary by default 
but also accepts a different raise
amount. Write a test case for 
Employee. Write two test methods,
test_give_default _raise() and   
test_give_custom_raise(). Use the    
setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to
create a new employee instance in 
each test method. Run your test case,
and make sure both tests pass.

solution ___________
class Employee:
    """A class to represent an employee."""
 def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, annual_salary):
        """Initialize name and salary attributes."""
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.annual_salary = annual_salary
  def give_raise(self, amount=5000):
        """Increase annual salary by default $5,000 or a custom amount."""
        self.annual_salary += amount
